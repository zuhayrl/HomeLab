## Setting up WSL

**WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux is a built in linux terminal for windows.**

Run the command prompt or powershell in administrator mode. Then type in the following command:
``` 
wsl --install
```
This will by default install Ubuntu. If you wish to choose another distro then run `wsl --list --online` to see a list of available distros and run `wsl --install -d <DistroName>` to install a distro.


## Setting Up a Samba Server on your Pi

1. First update your Pi:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

2. Then install the samba package:
```
sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
```

3. Now you need to choose the folder you would like to share:
- Create a new folder:
```
mkdir /home/username/shared
```
- Choose an existing folder:
(I like to set my entire drive as the folder so that i can easily access any files from my main pc)

4. Next we need to configure the samba config file `smb.conf` to handle access:
```
[pishare]
path = /home/username/shared
writeable = yes
browseable = yes
create mask=0777directory mask=0777
public=no
```

`[pishare]` : The name of the share. This is what shows up on the network when browsing shared folders.
`path = /home/username/shared` : The actual location of the shared folder on the Raspberry Pi.
`writeable = yes` : Allows users to create, modify, or delete files within the shared folder.
`browseable = yes` : Makes the share visible when browsing the network.
`create mask = 0777` : Sets full permissions (read, write, execute) for all newly created files in the shared folder.
`directory mask = 0777` : Sets full permissions for newly created directories.
`public = no` : Disables guest access â€” only authenticated users can access the share.
