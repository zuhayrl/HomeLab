Here‚Äôs a **workflow-based Git tutorial** that outlines common workflows in teams and projects.

# GIT WORKFLOW TUTORIAL

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Feature Branching Workflow**

This is a popular workflow for developing new features or bug fixes in isolation. It ensures that the `main` (or `develop`) branch remains stable.

### Steps:

1. **Start from the main branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

3. **Work on your feature**

   * Commit as you go:

     ```bash
     git add <file>
     git commit -m "Feature implementation"
     ```

4. **Push the feature branch**
   Share it with teammates.

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   Create a PR on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket to merge your feature branch into `main` (or `develop`).

6. **Rebase before merging (Optional, recommended)**
   If there have been updates to `main`, rebase your branch.

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

7. **Resolve conflicts (if any)**
   If there are merge conflicts, resolve them in the conflicting files, then:

   ```bash
   git add <resolved_file>
   git rebase --continue
   ```

8. **Final commit and merge**

   * After resolving conflicts, commit the final changes, and merge into the `main` branch through the PR.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Git Flow Workflow**

The **Git Flow** model provides a strict branching model for collaboration.

### Branches in Git Flow:

* **main**: Contains production-ready code.
* **develop**: Main branch for development work.
* **feature/**: For new features.
* **release/**: For preparing a new production release.
* **hotfix/**: For fixing bugs in production.

### Steps:

1. **Start from the develop branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   For new features:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

3. **Work on the feature and commit**

   * Keep your commits focused.

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   git commit -m "Feature work"
   ```

4. **Finish the feature**
   Once finished, merge the feature into `develop`:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git merge feature/feature-name
   git push origin develop
   ```

5. **Create a release branch (optional)**
   When the development for the next release is complete:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b release/v1.0
   ```

6. **Finalize the release**

   * Once testing and bug fixing are done, merge `release/v1.0` into `main` and `develop`.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v1.0
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **Create a hotfix (if necessary)**
   If a bug is found in production, create a hotfix branch from `main`.

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1
   ```

8. **Merge the hotfix**
   After the fix is applied, merge into both `main` and `develop`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/1.0.1
   git push origin main

   git checkout develop
   git merge hotfix/1.0.1
   git push origin develop
   ```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Forking Workflow**

This workflow is common in open-source projects where developers work on their own forks of a repository.

### Steps:

1. **Fork the repository**
   Fork the repo on GitHub/GitLab.

2. **Clone the forked repository**
   Clone your fork to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   ```

3. **Add the original repository as a remote**
   Set up the original repo as an upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-author/repo-name.git
   ```

4. **Sync your fork**
   Before working on a new feature, pull the latest changes from the original repository:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

5. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

6. **Work on the feature and commit**

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   git commit -m "Feature work"
   ```

7. **Push the feature to your fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/feature-name
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   Go to your fork on GitHub/GitLab and create a PR to the original repository's `main` branch.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Release Management Workflow**

This workflow is for handling stable releases and ensures that a release branch only includes changes that are production-ready.

### Steps:

1. **Create a release branch**
   Start from `main` to prepare the next release:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b release/v1.0
   ```

2. **Prepare the release**
   Final bug fixes, testing, and updates should happen in the release branch.

3. **Merge the release into `main`**
   Once the release is ready, merge it into `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge release/v1.0
   git tag v1.0
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

4. **Merge the release back into `develop`**
   It's important to also merge the release branch back into `develop` to include any changes that were made.

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge release/v1.0
   git push origin develop
   ```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Hotfix Workflow**

This workflow is used to quickly patch critical bugs found in the production environment.

### Steps:

1. **Create a hotfix branch from `main`**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1
   ```

2. **Apply the hotfix**
   Commit the necessary bug fixes:

   ```bash
   git add <file>
   git commit -m "Critical bug fix"
   ```

3. **Merge the hotfix into `main`**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/1.0.1
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Merge the hotfix into `develop`**
   Since development may have continued in `develop`, merge the hotfix back:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git merge hotfix/1.0.1
   git push origin develop
   ```
